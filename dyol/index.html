		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Holy Wars">Holy Wars</a></h1><p><span class="p">Software engineers are very passionate about what they do and which choices they make in doing it.

		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="IDE GUI">IDE GUI</a></h1><p><span class="p">Most IDEs divide the screen space among areas with different functionality: one for navigating through adjacent programs, one for editing the code, one for reviewing the architecture, one for watching how values change at runtime, etc. Advanced IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse or VS.NET have so many subwindows that the user has to choose which ones to keep open at each given time.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi A">Positioning</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Inheritance">Inheritance</a></h1><p><span class="p">An "is-a" relation can be represented by a language construct when one class, object or function <em>inherits</em> all the properties of its <em>parent</em> and possibly adds others exclusive to itself.

		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Input/Output">Input/Output</a></h1><p><span class="p">Most programs are not self-contained and require input data to run and produce results, which in turn need to be propagated somewhere. There are languages that are volatile with input and output, those that only work with files, those that wrap I/O as a side effect of a monad, etc.</span></p><h6>CPL:187<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Iteration">Iteration</a></h1><p><span class="p">There are many looping constructs, ranging from the imperative classics such as a for loop, to the functional classics such as <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em> and <em>fold</em> (or <em>reduce</em>). It is not uncommon for languages to support only some of these constructs. Some older GPLs and 4GLs also have one iterative construct which can be annotated with all kinds of conditions and steppers.</span></p><h6>CPL:89<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Keywords">Keywords</a></h1><p><span class="p">Special words that carry identical meaning across all possible programs in the same language.

		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Labelling">Labelling</a></h1><p><span class="p">Since most engineers know several languages, some language manuals directly assume some initial familiarity of their users with other languages. Can refer to paradigms or families (<em>"this is a <a href="#Type Check">strongly typed</a> functional language"</em>) or directly to other languages (<em>"<a href="#Inheritance">inheritance</a> works like in Java"</em>).</span></p><h6><span class="dwi M">Anchoring</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Language & Platform">Language & Platform</a></h1><p><span class="p">Making a great language and providing support for it only for one particular hardware platform, OS or IDE, implicitly forces people to use them. For instance, malware practices of JRE installers turned a lot of users agains JVM, which deprived them of languages like Scala or Clojure. Another example is .NET Core, a redesign of the .NET Framework which allows typically Windows-specific code to run on Linux.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi M">Format lock-in/out</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Lazy Evaluation">Lazy Evaluation</a></h1><p><span class="p">A <em>lazy</em> compiler defers evaluation to the latest possible moment. Lazy languages allow infinite data structures (as long as they are processed one chunk at a time) and may have unpredictable outcomes if calculations are allowed to have side effects (like C's ++). Lazy evaluation has many applications from code optimisation to stream data processing.</span></p><h6>CPL:239<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Live Feedback">Live Feedback</a></h1><p><span class="p">An advanced IDE running on modern hardware can utilise its idle cycles to attempt parsing, compilation, dependency analysis and other kinds of checks while the language user is still typing the program. Errorneous and suspicious pieces of code are commonly underlined with red or yellow squiggly lines familiar from natural word processors.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi I">Real-time feedback</span><h6></span></div>

		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Memes">Memes</a></h1><p><span class="p">LOLCODE, Arnold, Shakespeare and others are languages developed based on the memes that are circulating among software engineers: the popularity of them piggybacks entirely on the viral nature of those memes.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi L">Make it a meme</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Modules">Modules</a></h1><p><span class="p">Large programs inevitably outgrow their creators' capabilities to understand them all at once. Comprehension can be aided greatly by the language providing modules, packages, classes, procedures and other elements to group related code fragments together. Modern IDEs can analyse code for cohesion and coupling to help improve modularisation.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi A">Segmentation &amp; spacing</span>, CPL:113, <span class="dwi P">Proximity &amp; grouping</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Numeric Data Types">Numeric Data Types</a></h1><p><span class="p">Often gets overlooked at the early stages of language design, but could significantly shape the application area of the language. There are many integer <a href="#Type Check">types</a>, distinguished by their byte sizes and therefore value ranges; also decimal types with fixed scale and precision, and floating point types good for scientific computations but not for handling finances.</span></p><h6>CPL:63<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Operator Precedence">Operator Precedence</a></h1><p><span class="p">To avoid excessive use of parentheses, a language can provide a default convention of disambiguating constructs with 3+ entities bound by binary operators. In arithmetic expressions, the precedence usually follows mathematical laws.</span></p><h6>CPL:79<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Parametrised Types">Parametrised Types</a></h1><p><span class="p">Some <a href="#Type Check">types</a> can be defined partially by the user and partially by the language designer. For example, the language designer knows what a <a href="#Composite Types"><em>list</em></a> is, and the language user can select any other type for list elements — this will change handling of such elements, but the philosophy behind their collection will stay the same.</span></p><h6>CPL:180<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Performance Testing">Performance Testing</a></h1><p><span class="p">Performance testing and its variations like profiling and stress testing are commonly desired nice-to-have features in IDEs.

		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Phases">Phases</a></h1><p><span class="p">Breaking a process into phases is one of the most used divide-and-conquer principles applied in language processing. Most compilers are designed to work in phases, and different competences and skills are required to implement each phase.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi I">Partial completion</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Picture Clause">Picture Clause</a></h1><p><span class="p">A <a href="#Type Check">data type</a> that saves a specially formatted entity (usually a float or a date) that can be used directly in printing statements but also manipulated as data.</span></p><h6><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Pointers">Pointers</a></h1><p><span class="p">A popular data type in low level languages, representing a memory address where the data structure is stored — which is more efficient to pass across functions than the structure itself. The <a href="#Type Check">type</a> of the structure needs to be known to decipher itse contents, since the pointer itself is nothing more than a number.</span></p><h6>CPL:69<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Preview">Preview</a></h1><p><span class="p">Some features are very useful in general, but implemented in a way that sometimes fails. In this case, the impact of an application of a feature can be explicitly examined by the language user before agreeing to proceed. Common for database queries and object-oriented refactorings.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi I">Simulation &amp; feedforward</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Procedures">Procedures</a></h1><p><span class="p">Pieces of code that can be executed from other places in the program, are common to all languages, since they promote reuse, but they are designed differently. Some languages only allow them to be attached to an object (methods) or a class (static methods), others provide special synchronisation mechanisms to procedures to cooperate (coroutines, delegates), etc.</span></p><h6>CPL:106<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Program Smells">Program Smells</a></h1><p><span class="p">A <em>smell</em> is found when a code fragment has suspicious characteristics even without being wrong. Modern computer science identifies smells for code, architecture, spreadsheets, models, hardware, grammars, etc. The very use of the word "smell" strongly implies that any neat self-respecting language user should try to leave less of those when touching the code.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi C">Desire for order</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Records">Records</a></h1><p><span class="p">Many languages have some kinds of records or structures that bundle several related pieces of data without attaching methods to work with that data. A dynamic variation thereof is known as a dictionary or a map (e.g., hashmap) and it allows users to add and remove fields at runtime.</span></p><h6>CPL:169<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Redefines">Redefines</a></h1><p><span class="p">Once something has been defined, it can be redefined in many languages: <a href="#Inheritance">derived classes</a> can overload base classes' properties, local variables can shadow the global ones with the same name, the same memory fragment can be treated as belonging to two separate <a href="#Type Check">data types</a>, etc.</span></p><h6>CPL:138<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Static Analysis">Static Analysis</a></h1><p><span class="p">If a language does not directly limit its users' ability to express thing in a "bad" way, this is still possible for the compiler of the language. Parsing, <a href="#Type Check">type checking</a>, dependence analysis, formatting, conventions are all examples of this.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi A">Roadblock</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Substitution">Substitution</a></h1><p><span class="p">When a subprogram specifies the <a href="#Type Check">types</a> of input it expects, these types do not need to be treated precisely: often one can use entities of subtypes of the specified types (e.g., put a circle in a function that draws a shape because a circle is a subtype of shape). Subtyping is nontrivial, and the language designer must choose among covariance, contravariance, invariance, etc.</span></p><h6>CPL:197<h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Synchronisation">Synchronisation</a></h1><p><span class="p">Managing the use of resources by some predefined form of synchronisation between readers and writers.

		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Type Definitions">Type Definitions</a></h1><p><span class="p">Several GPLs and many DSLs can exist perfectly without ever needing any user-defined types.
