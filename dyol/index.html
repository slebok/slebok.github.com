		<div class="card"><h1 id="Assertion">Assertion</h1><p>This non-invasive form of <a href="#Exception_Handling">exception handling</a> allows language users to explicitly state (<em>assert</em>) invariants, pre-conditions and post-conditions as logic expressions that must universally hold. Such assertions can be easily removed before deploying the system into production.</p><h6></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Assignment">Assignment</h1><p>Moving a data structure into another data structure. Some <abbr title="Fourth Generation Languages">4GLs</abbr> have separate statements for straightforward (byte-copying) and composite (pattern-matching) assignments. In modern languages the source data structure can usually be created on the fly.

Every choice in the evaluation path becomes a <em>save point</em> to which the computation returns in case of failure. All the changes made between the save point and the point of failure are undone. Backtracking is common in parsers and logic programming, and used for <a href="#Exception_Handling">error recovery</a> everywhere else.</p><h6><span class="dwi I">DwI:Kairos</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:516</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:378</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:174</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:688</span></h6></div>

Ideally, this code should eventually be rewritten and coevolved.</p><h6><span class="dwi M">DwI:Worry resolution</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Big_Brother">Big Brother</h1><p>A more invasive and more powerful form of <a href="#Code_Mining">code mining</a> is examining language users' actions directly. This can be done through the <a href="#IDE">IDE</a> by equipping the plugin with logging functionality: make it record every single action taken by the user, with all the necessary context such as the files opened, and analyse it later.</p><h6><span class="dwi A">DwI:Pave the cowpaths</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Block">Block</h1><p>Viewing a list of statements as a specific (<em>compound</em>) kind of statement is a conceptual eye-opener and allows to treat composite constructs in a uniform and <a href="#Orthogonal_Design">orthogonal</a> way (<em>if … begin … end</em> and <em>do … begin … end</em> instead of <em>if … endif</em> and <em>do … enddo</em>).

		<div class="card"><h1 id="Branching">Branching</h1><p>Forking the computation based on conditions known at runtime, is a popular construct. Control flow can be transferred unconditionally (<em>branch, jump, goto</em>), or conditionally (based on true/false, zero/positive/negative, explicit condition, exhaustive patterns, etc).</p><h6><span class="pl cpl">CPL:86</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:42</span>, <span class="pl wcc">WCC:61</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:357</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:31</span>, <span class="pl a60">A60:20</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:282</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:474</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:38</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:87</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:580</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Built-in_Pattern">Built-in Pattern</h1><p>Design patterns, implementation patterns and architecture patterns are used across language boundaries, but many domain-specific languages incorporate well-known patterns as native language constructs: Model-View-Controller, Singleton, State, Visitor, etc.</p><h6><span class="dwi A">DwI:Simplicity</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Character_Type">Character Type</h1><p>A family of <a href="#Type_Check">value types</a> that can be used in a language: single characters, special characters, zero-terminated strings, fixed length strings, variable length strings, structured strings, etc.</p><h6><span class="pl cpl">CPL:67</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:185</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:215</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:25</span>, <span class="pl a60">A60:81</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:43</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:35</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Class">Class</h1><p>A class or a trait represents a template that can be followed by objects: a particular collection of properties and methods that can be always relied on. A class can be then <em>instantiated</em> with appropriate parameters to form an object that <em>conforms to</em> the class definition. Classes are the ultimate form of <a href="#Encapsulation">encapsulation</a>. They can be <a href="#Inheritance">inherited</a> from one another to form <a href="#Substitution">subclasses</a>.</p><h6><span class="pl cpl">CPL:107</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:464</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:544</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="ClientServer">Client/Server</h1><p>A language may allow one conceptual program to be split into two intercommunicating and <a href="#Synchronisation">synchronised</a> components: the <em>server</em> side which has access to all the necessary system data and runs in a fully controlled environment, and the <em>client</em> side which runs closer to the system user's data and has to survive in a much less controllable environment. Client code and server code can be written in different languages or compiled to different languages before deployment.</p><h6><span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:526</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Code_Completion">Code Completion</h1><p>Many <a href="#IDE">IDEs</a> monitor what the language user is typing and make suggestions based on their knowledge of the language keywords, constructs allowed in the context, variables visible from the current namespace, etc. The list of such suggestions must be short to be useful, otherwise it does nothing but annoy the users.</p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Choice editing</span>, <span class="dwi E">DwI:Portions</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Code_Generation">Code Generation</h1><p><a href="#Generation">Generation</a> of machine code, intermediate code, a program in a target language, an output model or a textual result, is the last <a href="#Phased_Process">phase</a> of a classic compiler (before or after <a href="#Optimisation">optimisation</a>). What is typical for code generation is the richness of the input (generously annotated intermediate graphs) and a deliberate limitedness of the output (which is often platform-specific). In <abbr title="Model-Driven Engineering">MDE</abbr> code generation is usually implemented by model-to-text transformations.</p><h6><span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:111</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:253</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:518</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:445</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:137</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:313</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Code_Mining">Code Mining</h1><p>Besides user surveys and expert opinions, there is a third way to uncover points to improve the language in its next versions: examining existing artefacts created in this language. There are many modern techniques in mining software repositories and machine learning that can be helpful here.</p><h6><span class="dwi I">DwI:Peer feedback</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Code_Ownership">Code Ownership</h1><p>Signing the user's name under a piece of code has the same effect as signing a person's name on an item: caring about what happens to the item later. <a href="#Comment">Comments</a> explaining which dev made which code changes existed since very early on. In modern ecosystems, ownership is tracked automatically by a version control system and can be checked at any time (<em>git blame</em>).</p><h6><span class="dwi P">DwI:Watermarking</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Code_Review">Code Review</h1><p>A family of practices around other developers reviewing the code submitted by one of them. Can vary in frequency, volatility, scrutiny, responsibility, intent, etc.</p><h6><span class="dwi S">DwI:Peerveillance</span>, <span class="dwi S">DwI:Sousveillance</span>, <span class="dwi S">DwI:Surveillance</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Comment">Comment</h1><p>Comments are pieces of <a href="#Documentation">documentation</a> built directly into the source of the system. Most <a href="#IDE">IDEs</a> support comments visually by presenting them in a completely different colour, usually dimmer than the rest of the program, to focus developers on executable constructs first. In some languages like BibTeX or INTERCAL everything uncompilable is a comment.</p><h6><span class="dwi P">DwI:Contrast</span>, <span class="pl cpl">CPL:12</span>, <span class="pl eml">EML:23</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:99</span>, <span class="pl a60">A60:36</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:33</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:71</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Commit_Hook">Commit Hook</h1><p>In many version control systems it is possible to write system scripts and let them run automatically on the client side (when a language user is preparing a commit) or on the server side (when the changes are shared with others). Such scripts are used to check conformance with language conventions and thus form and influence patterns of its use.</p><h6><span class="dwi C">DwI:Habits</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Compilation_Error">Compilation Error</h1><p>Modern languages have many means of assessing executability of the program before it is actually run. Thus, compilers tend to have a sophisticated error handling facility and try to provide enough information for the language user to fix the problems. Some languages are notoriously known for providing bad error messages. There are many ways to <em>recover</em> from an error in order to analyse the rest of the program and report multiple problems at once. Can be provided as a <a href="#Live_Feedback">live feedback</a>.</p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Conditional warnings</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:109</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:303</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:21</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:88</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:39</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:95</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Compilation_Warning">Compilation Warning</h1><p>When a compiler detects a possibly dangerous situation with extremely limited applicability, it displays a warning message and proceeds with the build process anyway. In many cases there is a special option for disabling a particular warning for a particular piece of code. Warnings can be given when an <em>anomaly</em> or a <a href="#Program_Smell">smell</a> is detected, and may involve some form of <em>error correction</em>. Can be provided as a <a href="#Live_Feedback">live feedback</a>.</p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Did you mean?</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:304</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:382</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:34</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:79</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:121</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Composite_Type">Composite Type</h1><p>Arrays, lists, tuples, sets and multisets are the most common <a href="#Type_Definition">user-defined</a> <a href="#Parametrised_Type">parametrised</a> types for collections of elements. It is up to the language designer to decide which ones are supported and how they are handled — can elements within on collection have different types, are they mutable, <a href="#Parameter_Passing">passed</a> by name/value/reference, etc.</p><h6><span class="pl cpl">CPL:156</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:70</span>, <span class="pl wcc">WCC:83</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:238</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:23</span>, <span class="pl a60">A60:37</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:39</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:599</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:30</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:123</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:473</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Comprehensions">Comprehensions</h1><p>List and set comprehensions are language constructs resembling the mathematical notation for constructing a set by its characteristic function, and combine <em>map</em> and <em>filter</em> classical for functional programming. Comprehensions as a language construct exist in Haskell, Python, Rascal and some other languages.</p><h6><span class="pl mcd">MCD:621</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Concrete_Syntax">Concrete Syntax</h1><p>The way to describe the concrete representation of the programs. The concrete syntax is used by humans to read, write, create and understand sentences of the language. Usually the only languages that do not have concrete syntax are those intended for internal intermediate representation. Some languages have more than one.</p><h6><span class="dwi P">DwI:Transparency</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:89</span>, <span class="pl eml">EML:21</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:41</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:17</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:28</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:166</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:115</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Concurrency">Concurrency</h1><p>Sometimes a program can be decomposed into components that are executable in parallel on different CPU cores or different devices. This can be completely undesirable, or performed automatically, or use the language user's guidance in <a href="#Synchronisation">synchronisation</a> of threads, tasks and processes.</p><h6><span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:483</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:32</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:571</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:331</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Conditional_Compilation">Conditional Compilation</h1><p>Some conditions can be checked during compile type and result in different code to be produced by the compiler to be run later. This is frequently used in situations when one codebase specifies the behaviour of a system that must be compiled and deployed under a variety of devices and hardware architectures. To simplify compiler construction, conditional compilation can be handled by a preprocessor.</p><h6><span class="pl hcd">HCD:275</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:107</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Cross-compilation">Cross-compilation</h1><p>A cross-compiler, or a <em>transpiler</em>, works on one platform but ultimately targets another. Relying on a cross-compiler allows to separate the development platform from the one where the programs get deployed to — for instance, a mobile app developer can work with a proper keyboard and a big screen. The <a href="#IDE">IDE</a> for a cross-compiled language may include a <a href="#Virtual_Machine">virtual machine</a> for execution, <a href="#Debugging">debugging</a>, etc. A compiler capable of producing code for different targets, is called <em>retargetable</em>.</p><h6><span class="pl gdb">GDB:24</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:32</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Debugging">Debugging</h1><p>The activity of finding and fixing sources of incorrect behaviour is not enjoyed by many language users, but is used by all of them without exception anyway. Declarative languages are the hardest to debug and imperative ones are the easiest. Most modern languages are shipped with a dedicated debugger or have debugging functionality in the <a href="#IDE">IDE</a>.</p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Are you sure?</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:55</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:322</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:263</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:261</span>, <span class="dwi E">DwI:Interlock</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Default">Default</h1><p>Unchanged configuration options, uninitialised <a href="#Variable">variables</a> and unspecified optional <a href="#Access_Modifier">modifiers</a> are examples of situations when a default value must be used by the compiler. These default values are decided by the language designer and typically represent the <em>best</em> option within the paradigm.</p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Defaults</span>, <span class="dwi E">DwI:Opt-outs</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Deprecated_Construct">Deprecated Construct</h1><p>In language evolution, sometimes a no longer desired construct cannot be simply removed to avoid breaking <a href="#Backward_Compatibility">backward compatibility</a>. However, it can be marked explicitly as deprecated to discourage language users to rely on it.</p><h6><span class="dwi A">DwI:Feature deletion</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Design_ChartDiagram">Design Chart/Diagram</h1><p><abbr title="Unified Modelling Language">UML</abbr> distinguishes between structural (<a href="#Class">class</a>, <a href="#Module">package</a>, object, component, composite structure, deployment) and behavioural diagrams (activity, sequence, use case, state, communication, interaction overview, timing). The former specify and visualise structure breakdown, the latter — events and interaction. Some languages (e.g., syntactic diagrams) are both.</p><h6><span class="dwi P">DwI:Possibility trees</span>, <span class="pl eml">EML:30</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:363</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:90</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:79</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:13</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:100</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:63</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:215</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Developer_Communication">Developer Communication</h1><p>A communication channel among language users that is open at all or almost all times during development. Can take a form of a specially designed office, skype chat rooms, slack channels, etc.</p><h6><span class="dwi A">DwI:Converging &amp; diverging</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Documentation">Documentation</h1><p>Language manuals are important for people learning the language, as well as for active users — sometimes these are two different sets of documents. Documentation may contain executable examples and can/should be automatically checked for internal validity and consistency with the tooling. Many elements of the language implementation ooze into its documentation (e.g., using a grammar both to define the <a href="#Concrete_Syntax">concrete syntax</a> and enumerate language constructs in a manual).</p><h6><span class="dwi M">DwI:Serving suggestion</span>, <span class="pl eml">EML:264</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:532</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Encapsulation">Encapsulation</h1><p>Most high level language abstract from low level details like video memory access, memory allocation, register values, caching, etc. Depending on the language philosophy, these features may be prohibited or just hard to find for beginners. Data structures can also be encapsulated by bundling them into <a href="#Record">records</a> or <a href="#Class">classes</a>, and code can be organised in hierarchical <a href="#Module">modules</a>.</p><h6><span class="dwi A">DwI:Hiding things</span>, <span class="pl cpl">CPL:104</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:12</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:236</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Energy_Saving">Energy Saving</h1><p>Computationally heavy code requires more CPU or GPU cycles, which consumes more power, which in turn makes the applications spend more energy. Making a compiler of a language especially <a href="#Optimisation">optimised</a> towards power reduction may increase its appeal for users that intend to run their programs on devices with limited power (mobile phones and smaller). Power reduction and energy saving techniques also contribute towards global sustainability, and can be used/chosen for ethical reasons.</p><h6><span class="dwi C">DwI:Assuaging guilt</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:443</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Enumeration_Type">Enumeration Type</h1><p>An enumeration is a <a href="#Type_Definition">data type</a> that defines a very limited set of possible values which are, nevertheless, more comfortably referred to by their names and not by encoded numbers. The most famous enumeration is the Boolean (logical) type, which contains only two values: <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>. If the domain permits, the language does not have to support user-defined enumerations.</p><h6><span class="pl cpl">CPL:66</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:188</span>, <span class="pl wcc">WCC:65</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:213</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:21</span>, <span class="pl a60">A60:65</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:550</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:29</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:123</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:533</span></h6></div>

The challenging nature makes people engage and compete in programming in such languages as a form of entertainment.</p><h6><span class="dwi L">DwI:Challenges &amp; targets</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Event_Loop">Event Loop</h1><p>This pattern in user interface implementation turns entire program into a giant loop waiting for the user to activate its functionality by choosing the way to communicate (click, tap, edit, etc). Since direct implementations are not <a href="#Energy_Saving">green</a> (consume too much energy), it can be built natively into the language and optimised by the compiler and hardware.</p><h6><span class="dwi I">DwI:Feedback through form</span>, <span class="pl cpl">CPL:265</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:473</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Exception_Handling">Exception Handling</h1><p>An emergency sibling of <a href="#Branching">branching</a> used for extraordinary situations — can be slower than the normal branching, but usually more robust in handling situations like a cricial failure during the handling of another failure.

		<div class="card"><h1 id="Execution_Error">Execution Error</h1><p>Errors can happen at <a href="#Compilation_Error">compile time</a>, but also at run time, due to hardware faults, communication problems, invalid user input or simply <a href="#Debugging">bugs</a> that were left undetected at compile time by <a href="#Static_Analysis">static analysis</a>. Some languages (Erlang) have very well-designed strategies for handling execution errors, but all others also feature some form of partial recovery from them. The language user controls runtime error handling with <a href="#Exception_Handling">exceptions</a>.</p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Conditional warnings</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:597</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Feature_Lock-out">Feature Lock-out</h1><p>Certain combinations of language features may be disabled (errorneous) by default, with a possibility of enabling them explicitly. For example, redefining a method in a derived class is only allowed in C# when a specific <em>override</em> keyword is used, which leaves visual cues to future readers of the piece of code in question.</p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Task lock-in/out</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="First_Class_Citizen">First Class Citizen</h1><p>It is an important design point to decide which entities within a program have the right to be saved, passed as arguments, transferred through other means, etc. Numbers?

		<div class="card"><h1 id="Garbage_Collection">Garbage Collection</h1><p>Automatic release of memory is impossible for cyclic data structures. Languages that want to support them, have a <em>garbage collector</em> — a runtime compiler component that occasionally <em>marks</em> data structures that have become inaccessible and then <em>sweeps</em> them away, freeing the memory. GC can compromise language responsiveness and performance.</p><h6><span class="dwi M">DwI:Bundling</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:443</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:471</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:476</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Generation">Generation</h1><p>Tedious, repetitive and error-prone programming tasks can be automated by using templates, wizards, explicit staging/morphing constructs of generative programming, construction workbenches, etc. In many practical cases the language user is allowed to edit the result to fine-tune it. The final generation <a href="#Phased_Process">phase</a> is called <a href="#Code_Generation">code generation</a>.</p><h6><span class="dwi A">DwI:Mazes</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:5</span>, <span class="pl eml">EML:119</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:8</span>, <span class="dwi I">DwI:Tunnelling &amp; wizards</span></h6></div>

		<div class="card"><h1 id="Trade_Off">Trade Off</h1><p>When direct <a href="#Optimisation">optimisation</a> is impossible or not sufficiently effective, the language designer can identify trade offs and leave them all inside the language for the users to choose. For example, many compilers have compilation options optimising <a href="#Code_Generation">code generation</a> for speed, size or <a href="#Energy_Saving">power</a>, but not all three. Many languages have <a href="#Standard_Library">libraries</a> and <a href="#Composite_Type">structures</a> for both <em>arrays</em> (fast, immutable length) and <em>lists</em> (slower but flexible).</p><h6><span class="dwi C">DwI:Framing</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:445</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Type_Check">Type Check</h1><p>Components can be identified, explicitly or automatically, to belong to a particular <em>type</em>. Among other things, the type determines applicability and compatibility of components with one another. In complex scenarios (like a monadic bind) hard to understand components can only fit together in one possible way. Type equivalence rules can be based on names, <a href="#Type_Definition">structure</a>, <a href="#Scope__Binding">scopes</a>, etc.</p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Matched affordances</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:129</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:195</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:26</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:49</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:489</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:91</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:521</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Type_Definition">Type Definition</h1><p>Several <abbr title="General Purpose Languages">GPLs</abbr> and many <abbr title="Domain-Specific Languages">DSLs</abbr> can exist perfectly without ever needing any user-defined types. However, in many cases it can prove useful to allow the language user to make their own <a href="#Record">data structures</a> and algebraic data types to provide their input for the <a href="#Type_Check">type checker</a>.</p><h6><span class="pl cpl">CPL:60</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:268</span>, <span class="pl wcc">WCC:26</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:186</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:234</span>, <span class="pl a60">A60:15</span>, <span class="pl gdb">GDB:314</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:489</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:25</span>, <span class="pl wci">WCI:111</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:522</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Undefined_Behaviour">Undefined Behaviour</h1><p>When a particular combination of language constructs is not explicitly specified by the standard, its implementers can take different shortcuts in interpreting it. As a result, the same piece of code produces different results based on the compiler, the computer, time of day, etc. Common in legacy languages like C or COBOL.</p><h6><span class="dwi M">DwI:Antifeatures &amp; crippleware</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:598</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Unification">Unification</h1><p>Given two <a href="#Composite_Type">composite data structures</a>, a compiler can be tasked to find their matching components and proceed with <a href="#Assignment">assignment</a>, transformation, etc. Limited forms of unification may be called <em>pattern matching</em>. Widely used in logic programming, metaprogramming, model synchronisation, bidirectional transformation, <abbr title="Fourth Generation Languages">4GLs</abbr> for banking, etc.</p><h6><span class="pl cpl">CPL:248</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:507</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:369</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:622</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Variable">Variable</h1><p>These named memory areas are thought to be fundamental for the nature of computation — and they are within the von Neumann paradigm, which is not the only choice modern designers have. One can make their language more functional and force its users to think about data flow, or make it more imperative and let them worry about where the intermediate data is stored.</p><h6><span class="pl cpl">CPL:52</span>, <span class="pl ppl">PPL:22</span>, <span class="pl wcc">WCC:72</span>, <span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:183</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:9</span>, <span class="pl a60">A60:5</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:522</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:26</span></h6></div>
		<div class="card"><h1 id="Virtual_Machine">Virtual Machine</h1><p>An emulator for a real or imaginary hardware architecture that has a low level coding language that can be used by other components or tools to compiler high level languages to. VMs trades off performance for an extra layer of abstraction. Some virtual machines (e.g., <a href="https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiLimbo_(programming_language)">Dis</a>) compile their code into native machine code just before running it.</p><h6><span class="pl pzpl">PZPL:75</span>, <span class="pl wgcc">WGCC:271</span>, <span class="pl hcd">HCD:446</span>, <span class="pl acdi">ACDI:767</span>, <span class="pl mcd">MCD:450</span></h6></div>
