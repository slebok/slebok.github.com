Another example is .NET Core, a redesign of the .NET Framework which allows typically Windows-specific code to run on Linux.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi M">DwI:Format lock-in/out</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Pointers">Pointers</a></h1><p><span class="p">A popular data type in low level languages, representing a memory address where the data structure is stored — which is more efficient to pass across functions than the structure itself. The <a href="#Type Check">type</a> of the structure needs to be known to decipher itse contents, since the pointer itself is nothing more than a number.</span></p><h6><span class="pl">CPL:69</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:206</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Pretty-printing">Pretty-printing</a></h1><p><span class="p">A language can have a <a href="#Defaults">default</a> formatting convention that is not only accepted by the community to improve the representation quality of the programs, but also automated and shipped in a form of a tool. Such a tool can be very configurable, have limited feature selection or none at all.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi P">DwI:Implied sequences</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:89</span>, <span class="pl">EML:23</span><h6></span></div>

In this case, the impact of an application of a feature can be explicitly examined by the language user before agreeing to proceed. Common for database queries and <a href="#Refactoring">object-oriented refactorings</a>.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi I">DwI:Simulation &amp; feedforward</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Procedures">Procedures</a></h1><p><span class="p">Pieces of code that can be executed from other places in the program, are common to all languages, since they promote reuse, but they are designed differently. Some languages only allow them to be attached to an object (methods) or a class (static methods), others provide special <a href="#Synchronisation">synchronisation</a> mechanisms to procedures to cooperate (coroutines, delegates), etc.</span></p><h6><span class="pl">CPL:106</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:35</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Program Smells">Program Smells</a></h1><p><span class="p">A <em>smell</em> is found when a code fragment has suspicious characteristics even without being wrong. Modern computer science identifies smells for code, models, architecture, spreadsheets, hardware, grammars, etc. The very use of the word "smell" strongly implies that any neat self-respecting language user should try to leave less of those when touching the code.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi C">DwI:Desire for order</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Records">Records</a></h1><p><span class="p">Many languages have some kinds of records or structures that bundle several related pieces of data without attaching methods to work with that data. A dynamic variation thereof is known as a dictionary or a map (e.g., hashmap) and it allows users to add and remove fields at runtime.</span></p><h6><span class="pl">CPL:169</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:199</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Redefines">Redefines</a></h1><p><span class="p">Once something has been defined, it can be redefined in many languages: <a href="#Inheritance">derived classes</a> can overload base classes' properties, local variables can shadow the global ones with the same name, the same memory fragment can be treated as belonging to two separate <a href="#Type Check">data types</a>, etc.</span></p><h6><span class="pl">CPL:138</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:85</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Refactoring">Refactoring</a></h1><p><span class="p">Refactorings are code changes that do not impact the system's behaviour but change its internal structure to improve code quality, prepare for the subsequent change, etc. Few languages are co-designed with refactorings from the first day, but it is not uncommon to get refactoring support in the <a href="#IDE">IDE</a> afterwards.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi C">DwI:Rephrasing &amp; renaming</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Static Analysis">Static Analysis</a></h1><p><span class="p">If a language does not directly limit its users' ability to express thing in a "bad" way, this is still possible for the compiler of the language. Parsing, <a href="#Type Check">type checking</a>, dependence analysis, <a href="#Pretty-printing">formatting</a>, conventions are all examples of this. One of the language design principles states that if an error gets though one line of defence, it should be caught by the next one.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi A">DwI:Roadblock</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:7</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Substitution">Substitution</a></h1><p><span class="p">When a subprogram specifies the <a href="#Type Check">types</a> of input it expects, these types do not need to be treated precisely: often one can use entities of subtypes of the specified types (e.g., put a circle in a function that draws a shape because a circle is a subtype of shape). Subtyping is nontrivial, and the language designer must choose among covariance, contravariance, invariance, etc.</span></p><h6><span class="pl">CPL:197</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:208</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Synchronisation">Synchronisation</a></h1><p><span class="p">Managing the use of resources by some predefined form of synchronisation between readers and writers.

		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Syntactic Sugar">Syntactic Sugar</a></h1><p><span class="p">Nice-to-have constructs that are not extending the expressive power of the language, are sometimes not actually implemented directly — just expanded into bigger sequences of more primitive and less user-friendly constructs.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi P">DwI:Fake affordances</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Syntax Highlighting">Syntax Highlighting</a></h1><p><span class="p">A development environment of the language can profit from visualisation even if the language is textual by colour-coding different categories of words (strings, numbers, standard libraries, reserved words, etc).</span></p><h6><span class="dwi A">DwI:Material properties</span>, <span class="dwi P">DwI:Colour associations</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Type Check">Type Check</a></h1><p><span class="p">Components can be identified, explicitly or automatically, to belong to a particular <em>type</em>. Among other things, the type determines applicability and compatibility of components with one another. In complex scenarios (like a monadic bind) hard to understand components can only fit together in one possible way.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi E">DwI:Matched affordances</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:129</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Type Definitions">Type Definitions</a></h1><p><span class="p">Several <abbr title="General Purpose Languages">GPLs</abbr> and many <abbr title="Domain-Specific Languages">DSLs</abbr> can exist perfectly without ever needing any user-defined types. However, in many cases it can prove useful to allow the language user to make their own <a href="#Records">data structures</a> and algebraic data types to provide their input for the <a href="#Type Check">type checker</a>.</span></p><h6><span class="pl">CPL:60</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:268</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Undefined Behaviour">Undefined Behaviour</a></h1><p><span class="p">When a particular combination of language constructs is not explicitly specified by the standard, its implementers can take different shortcuts in interpreting it. As a result, the same piece of code produces different results based on the compiler, the computer, time of day, etc. Common in legacy languages like C or COBOL.</span></p><h6><span class="dwi M">DwI:Antifeatures &amp; crippleware</span><h6></span></div>
		<div class="tile"><span class="card"><h1><a name="Unification">Unification</a></h1><p><span class="p">Given two composite data structures, a compiler can be tasked to find their matching components and proceed with assignment, transformation, etc. Widely used in logic programming, metaprogramming, model synchronisation, bidirectional transformation, <abbr title="Fourth Generation Languages">4GLs</abbr> for banking, etc.</span></p><h6><span class="pl">CPL:248</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:507</span><h6></span></div>

One can make their language more functional and force its users to think about data flow, or make it more imperative and let them worry about where the intermediate data is stored.</span></p><h6><span class="pl">CPL:52</span>, <span class="pl">PPL:22</span><h6></span></div>
